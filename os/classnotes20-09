	Thread
____________________________________________


	Thread = path of execution within a process

	Thread has a life cycle
	Default thread in a process --- main thread 

	every process must have atleast one thread 

	when a thread is created --- 
		address space is not loaded like process creation 
		it shares the code,data and heap segments of default
		thread BUT it keeps its local data separately
		in a NEW STACK 


How to create a thread within a process ?
	pthread_t 
	pthread_create()
	pthread_self()
	sleep()
	pthread_join()
		this function blocks the calling thread
			till the argument thread is not finished
		when the argument thread completes
			the calling thread is UNBLOCKED
				and it can go to next instr.

SHELL Commands ----

	we can execute them in 2 ways ---
	1. give the command on the PROMPT
	2. write the commands in a file and run the file
		SHELL SCRIPT 
	3. run the command through C program ( exec )

File Handling Commands --------------
	File System, File , Directory related commands

	File System --- is a way to organize and store and retrieve
			files on the PARTITION 

	FAT32 , NTFS 
	Linux  --- EXT2FS /EXT3FS
	Find out FS on google !!!

	Format a partition ---- install the LAYOUT of the FS 


	Linux has only one topmost folder in its FS 
			/  


	windows FS you have many topmost folders - c:,d:,e: 


	cd -- change dir
	pwd -- present working dir ( current folder) 

	/home  folder will have
		subfolder per user having same name as username

	when you open your terminal you are in ~ ( tilde )

	~ = /home/iet  = it is the user's folder in /home


	. = current folder
	.. = previous/parent folder

	vi filename  will open the vi editor and the file
	vi editor - command line editor -- it opens in terminal

	initially editor is in command mode
	 we have to switch to input mode by "press i "
	switch to command mode using "esc"
	to save  type  " :w " 
	to save and quit type  " :wq "
	to quit without saving type " !q "
	to just quit  type  " q " ( when no changes are made )


	to see the contents of any file
	cat filename
